# React practice

This is a practice project.  It is using a card on a table layout like I did with Will's page, but with React.  I tried with 
React component classes and was frustrated.  Then I learned about the function components and hooks.  This works much better for 
me. Of note, we are using a .map routine to build a list of objects in a state, using useStates, using a ternary for checking input of a name,
using a form, onSubmit and event handler.
